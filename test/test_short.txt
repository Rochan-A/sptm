Oct 12 2009 	Nice trendy hotel location not too bad.	I stayed in this hotel for one night. As this is a fairly new place some of the taxi drivers did not know where it was and/or did not want to drive there. Once I have eventually arrived at the hotel, I was very pleasantly surprised with the decor of the lobby/ground floor area. It was very stylish and modern. I found the reception's staff geeting me with 'Aloha' a bit out of place, but I guess they are briefed to say that to keep up the coroporate image.As I have a Starwood Preferred Guest member, I was given a small gift upon-check in. It was only a couple of fridge magnets in a gift box, but nevertheless a nice gesture.My room was nice and roomy, there are tea and coffee facilities in each room and you get two complimentary bottles of water plus some toiletries by 'bliss'.The location is not great. It is at the last metro stop and you then need to take a taxi, but if you are not planning on going to see the historic sites in Beijing, then you will be ok.I chose to have some breakfast in the hotel, which was really tasty and there was a good selection of dishes. There are a couple of computers to use in the communal area, as well as a pool table. There is also a small swimming pool and a gym area.I would definitely stay in this hotel again, but only if I did not plan to travel to central Beijing, as it can take a long time. The location is ok if you plan to do a lot of shopping, as there is a big shopping centre just few minutes away from the hotel and there are plenty of eating options around, including restaurants that serve a dog meat!	
Sep 25 2009 	Great Budget Hotel!	Stayed two nights at Aloft on the most recent trip to China. The hotel was very modern and clean. The room was spotless and a comfortable king sized bed (as far as soft beds go in China). The staff was very punctual and went out of the way to help my every need, including going to a store across the street to purchase a China Mobile SIM card for me. The buffet breakfast was okay, nothing to write home about. The 42� LCD screen had movies on demand for 20RMB and had a good selection of western channels including HBO, CNN, BBC, Star World etc� The gym was small, had a selection of basic weights and one cable machine, there was however 6 new TechnoGym cardio machines with built in LCD TVs which were very good. The location is a bit out of the way to the central areas of Beijing, but it is better suited for my needs as I need to be in the Haidian district. Being SPG Platinum there were no upgrades to a better room, because Aloft has a policy of not doing any upgrades. The Sheraton next door is a much nicer hotel in my opinion (where I am writing this from now, with an upgraded room) but as far as bang for the buck, Aloft is a great place!	
Aug 4 2009 	Excellent value - location not a big problem.	We stayed at the Aloft Beijing Haidian for 5 nights from July 17 - 22nd. There are lots of reviews that talk about the location being a problem but we knew this ahead of time and found that it really wasn't an issue. The longest we spent in a taxi was about 30 minutes. We never paid more than 50rmb for a taxi ride (which is about $8 Cdn) and that was to the Forbidden City. Given there are 4 in our family, it was no big deal at all.As for the rooms, they were clean, the beds comfortable, the wireless internet connection reliable and it was one of the few hotels we found in Beijing that would accomodate 2 adults and 2 children. We paid about $70 Cdn. per night. That's an amazing price.It's not meant to be a 5 star hotel so you can't go in expecting that. We found the reception staff generally very helpful and friendly. They aren't the fastest in the world but it wasn't unreasonable at all.The hotel manager made an effort to speak with us a few times and was extremely helpful and welcoming. Their breakfast buffet was quite good and reasonably priced. There are a number of good restaurants in the Four Points Sheraton next door so there were lots of options. There is a massive mall about a block away that has other dining options as well.The only issue we ran into was a few taxi drivers refusing to take us to the Summer Palace because I guess they felt it wasn't far enough. The minimum rate is 10rmb. But the staff at the Four Points Sheraton (which is on a busier road than the side street for Aloft) were quite helpful in finding taxis for us if they weren't already there.We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to our friends for its excellent value.	
Jul 17 2009 	Stylish clean reasonable value poor location	I am glad to be the first person to post photos of this hotel. Key points about this property:- its a starwood property, much cheaper than the rest, and it shows in the pretty incompetent reception staff, the hard bed, the cheap blinds that don't quite block out the sun in the mornings, and common areas which seem to be degrading very quickly (given how new this hotel is).- on the up side, it is very clean and tidy, and if that is important to you, this hotel presents good value. It is also quite stylishly designed and looks much more modern than anything else in this price range.- location is poor for the typical tourist. Yes, very poor. It is not really close to much cheaper the summer palace, and other places will require a taxi, which will probably result in hours of being frustratingly stuck in traffic. Taxi drivers also dont know where it is. If coming from the East, (i.e. city centre or airport) then it is the right turn AFTER the Four Points hotel, which is adjacent. If you are trying to scam an SPG platinum status in the cheapest way possible, perhaps stay in these two adjacent SPG hotels for 25 nights and check out every night.On the whole I thought it was decent value, but dollar for dollar, I would personally prefer to pay double for the Westin in Chaoyang or Financial Street. I have stayed at both at approx. double the price, for real 5 star service. But if thats not in your budget and you want the assurance of an international hotel chain, this hotel is perfect for you.Lastly, this hotel may also be appropriate for university students in Haidian, but don't pick this unless you know what you are doing. Taxis to BLCU or Tsing Hua may be exceptionally frustrating because of constant traffic around Zhong guan cun street. Tell taxi drivers to go on the four ring road, even though it might be a bit more expensive.There is free internet, but it does not seem to work with iPhones.	
May 30 2009 	Remote but excellent value for money	Stayed there for one night. The hotel is located in Haidian, which is a little bit remote. But if you don't mind taking the taxi to the closest subway station, which costs only 15-20 CNY a ride the hotel represents excellent value for money given its low prices and the modern, quiet and very clean rooms. Also internet use is for free. Especially for travellors who don't want to spend the money for a Hyatt or Hilton but who look for a very decent place to stay this hotel represents an excellent choice.	
Dec 31 2008 	Good value but not downtown	This hotel is located next to the Four Points Hotel and are both part of the Starwood group. For those wanting a downtown location, this property may not be for you - I recommend factoring in taxi fares in and out of town when working out the value here. On the otherside, the rates for the hotel are very good and the rooms are basic but well appointed. TV was more focused on local channels which may be an indication of the clients they are targeting. There was however the standard HBO, BBC, etc. Staff were very friendly and check in and check out times were acceptable.

Nov 17 2009 	great room layout service value-would definitely return	we stayed in a 3 bedroomed-suite which was well furnished and the staff perfect hosts. they even organised a birthday cake for my Mum (we were all there to celebrate).could organise for massages / manicures in our suite, perfect for relaxing.located in the CBD so not great for tourists but plenty of remarkably good valued restaurants nearby.	
Nov 7 2009 	A quality hotel with quality service	We stayed at the Ascott Beijing this summer for 1 week in a family of 5. It is centrally located. When you are a european with kids staying for a few days it is ideal to have a fully equipped kitchen and a big Wal-Mart nearby. We had a modern and spacious apartment with a big LCD flat television. The service was really good and important for us not speaking the language: we never had to wait for a taxi and they always provided info for our directions.We would definitely return!	
Oct 16 2009 	clean rooms good location poor service	check-in:my friends are i arrived from different countries @ different times and were greeted in the same lousy way. the bellboy did not help with luggage. the doorman did not open door. and the receptionist took more than 5 minutes to greet us with no smile despite having no other guest in the lobby. in sum, not pleasant.room:we had the 2 bedroom suite. very spacious and comfy with all basic amenities. bathroom was spacious with separate bathtub and shower area equipped with l'occitaine toiletries. but they do not provide us with new ones even tho we have finished them. we had to ask the receptionist/concierge TWICE before getting more toiletries to shower. the washing machine is brilliant, but the 4 of us were not clever enough to work out how to wash and dry the 4 days we were there. Ended up doing the laundry by hand. location:central and within walking distance to the train station and food places. slight difficulty getting a taxi tho. 7eleven is just round the corner. and there's a starbucks on the ground floor.breakfast:small but good spread with standard egg station, fruits, breads and some local congee and hot food.massage/spa:we had massage and Chinese pedicure there. pedicurist is a man who told us how maggie cheung went there for a massage a while ago. quality of massage and pedicure was average.
